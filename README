# perled-pork
This project is comprised of two perl scripts. The first, mkimg.pl, is designed
to create random image files with an exif timestamp. The second, sortimg.pl, is
intended to organize (primarily image) files by their date into subfolders.

Requires:
	ImageMagick (tested with 8:6.8.9.9-5, needed by mkimg)
	ExifTool (Perhaps in libimage-exiftool-perl, tested with 9.74-1)
	perl (tested with v5.20.2)

Installation:
	Copy scripts to location of your choice. (such as /usr/local/bin)
	sudo cp mkimg.pl sortimg.pl /usr/local/bin
	sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/{mkimg.pl,sortimg.pl}

Usage:
	Both scripts contain extensive help available via -?
